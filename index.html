<h1>The object of this game is to stay alive as long as possible. Unfortunately, today is not your lucky day, 
and you will probably end up dead within seconds after beginning this game.
After you are assigned a character, you must make what you percieve as the safest choices for your character, 
based on their age and daily routine.</h1>
