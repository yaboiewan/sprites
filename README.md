# Sketch 7: Sprite Sheets

Use Piskel, Adobe Photoshop, or any other image creation software to
create a collection of sprites for a imaginary 2D video game inspired
by one of your early sketches (Event Score, Candy Land Mod, Twine
Game, or Avatar).

**Make a web page to display your sprites. Describe the premise of
your game in a short written paragraph (no more than 100 words). Make
sure you give your game a title and a goal for the player. You will
not be required to make this video game in this course. Beneath your
explanatory paragraph, display your sprites as GIFs (animated or
static). On this page, describe each sprite in exactly one sentence.**

## Rules
1. Your collection should include at least five sprites. Requirements:
    * At least *one* player character (does not need not be human, may
      be abstract)
    * At least *one* piece of scenery (could be something small, or
      could be an entire game board)
    * At least *one* object that can be collected, used, or possessed. 
    * At least *three* of your sprites should be animated.
2. The size of your sprites should not exceed 64 x 64 pixels per
frame. They can be smaller. They do not have to be square.
3. Each sprite should be saved in four different ways. 
    * Source document (.psd or .piskel)
    * Static or animated GIF (.gif)
    * A single page "sprite sheet" with all frames of the image in a grid (.png)
      NOTE: This file will be larger than 64x64 px if the image is animated.
    * An "image sequence" with a separate file for each frame of each
      sprite. Name your files with an underscore and a number. For instance:
      face_01.png, face_02.png, face_03.png. (.png)   
4. Display the GIFs on a web page that contains the paragraph-long
description of your game and the sentences about each GIF. Fork and
modify the GitHub project and post the link to your page on the class
blog.


## Learning Objectives
- More practice with illustration and animation using WYSIWYG editing software.
- Learn to adapt and/or translate game ideas in visual form.
- Consider the virtues and drawbacks of using sophisticated software (rather than code) to create images and animations.
- Channel your inner Warren Robinett (and/or Yoko Ono)
